      "My experience at Cara was AMAZING! I got Rejuran microneedling done, it took about 2 days to heal and I'm absolutely loving my results. My skin texture has improved tremendously, my skin feels so smooth, looks hydrated, reduced my pigment and overall completely rejuvenated it!! I recommend Cara to all my friends and family, they have always stood out and exceeded all my expectations! Thank you to Cara and all the lovely staff!",

      "Nurse Jennifer works magic with the Genesis laser! She was recommended to me by my mum (who received the toning laser treatment and I'm sooo happy I went! For context, I'm in my 30's, combination skin, Asian descent. I have lots of light acne scars, redness/rosacea (cheeks), uneven pigmentation, larger pores (nose/cheeks), etc. I wasn't sure what to expect, but Jennifer worked magic! I could tell the difference after just one session, and I couldn't wait for my second. (I got a package of 5 sessions.) She was really kind, thorough, answered all the questions I had before started, and made sure I was comfortable. I literally got compliments on my skin the first week after my treatment! Everything seems brighter, healthier, and more glowy. (I am already budgeting for my next bundle lol) They even provide full, 1-hour long facial afterwards!",

      "It's a must for this Center. From the front staff to the nurses to the doctor. I went in for filler (Sculptra) for the first time ever. I was greeted by the front office and then spoke to a consultant named Theresa who then referred me to nurse Julianna. Being my face, I was a little anxious but once Julianna informed me what Sculptra is for and gave me her recommendation, I was all in. Julianna made it so comfortable and answered all my questions. She even noticed I had a lot more volume loss on one side of my face and explained how much I needed and informed me exactly how many cc I would need so my face so it would be even. As soon and she finished, I saw the results immediately. I was so impressed by the change right away. She explained the aftercare and I was so extremely satisfied that I asked if I could add a lip flip. She was very sweet and checked with the front office to make sure my appointment did not over Lap with another. I was able to get my lip flip. I have even made an appointment to come back and discuss additional treatments/ surgeries with Theresa, the consultant. I can't wait to make my next appointment. Thank you Cara for making my Cara (face) look much younger.",

      'Where do I begin with my experience with Dr. Kahng?! I had a facelift by him like a little over week ago and I cannot believe how great it already looks!!! He must have a gentle hand because I healed very quickly with very little bruising. I chose him because I was really impressed with his before/ after pictures. He really understands our Asian facial anatomy and has a keen eye to beautify it. I am beyond happy to look in the mirror and see myself as young as I feel. I feel so confident and happy with the way I look now. Julie was the consultant that helped me through the whole process. She made me feel comfortable and confident through it all. She reassured me that everything was going to be fantastic and if I had any questions, she was only a phone call or text away. And I tested her patience many time with lots of stupid questions and she never batted an eye. She replied back and answered all my annoying questions. I hope Dr Kahng realizes what a gem he has. All the nurses were wonderful and this will forever be my place for future procedures. If you are looking for a brilliant surgeon, amazing staff and very reasonable pricing look no further!!! From the very bottom of my heart.... Thank you thank you thank you!!! I am over the moon with my results !!!!',

      "I'm doing another review according to how the actual surgery procedure went. So, I ended up deciding to have a surgery procedure done here. The entire process was smooth. All staff that helped me with the process were considerate, kind, and very knowledgable. They eased my nerves before the operation. When I had the consultation with the doctor before the operation and the check up with the doctor after the operation, the doctor proved to show what a great doctor he is. He was articulate in communicating the complications of my case and explained all things well, even during the recovery process of the operation. I trust him if I was to have any more procedures done in the future. Finally, he helped resolve and fix the complications that arose from a previous dissatisfied surgery procedure with another plastic surgeon. That's what mattered the most. Thus, I consider Dr. Kahng to be an intelligent plastic surgeon.",

      "Please trust me when I say they are AMAZING! The first time I went was for Botox, was with Vanessa. She was very understanding and not pushy at all (I've had experiences in different locations where they just wanted money instead of my happiness) I got Botox on my forehead and felt so comfortable and extremely happy with my results. While there I asked about fillers for my smile lines and lip filler, which they offer this service, I booked my appointment with Juliana. I was extremely nervous because I had never done fillers. Upon my arrival they were very sweet and patient with me, explained everything and began the numbing process. Juliana was very conservative with how much I should get, that's exactly what I wanted. I did NOT FEEL A THING!! the process was no more than 30-45 min and I am OBSESSED WITH MY FACE!!! They have a customer for life with me! I can't stop looking at myself you will not be disappointed!",

      "I am a 51 years old woman. I have done all types of non-invasive procedures, but at the end I decided to undergo surgery. I had my eyelids done couple years ago with Dr. Kahng and was very pleased with the results. Couple months back, I decided to do a neck and facelift surgery. I consulted with Dr. Kahng and went under operation. After about 3 months, I can't be happier! I am very happy with the results and once again I can look myself in the mirror again:-) Julie, was my consultant and she was awesome. She walked me through all steps of surgery and post- operations expectations.Overall, Cara Plastic Surgery team was awesome. Everyone at the office is friendly and professional. Dr. Kahng has superb bedside manner. I highly recommend Cara Plastic Surgery for all your cosmetic needs.",

      'I took my husband to Cara for his deep acne scars on face that he had since his teenage years. After counseling he was recommended to do multiple rounds of Secret microneedling for his acne scars. Chemical peel was not something we wanted to try due to its harshness, side effects and long healing time so we were happy to hear about the Secret needling. After each treatment his face was initially red for the first 2-3 days then it got better after that. His acne scars began to lighten noticeably after 2-3 session starting from his forehead and nose. We then extended for another rounds of the Secret needling. Now his overall complexion is cleaner and smoother than before! My husband hates needles and anything painful but the nursing staff here really made each session doable for him. He also noticed the small improvements after each session so he actually wanted to go back for more!! I also get my facials here as well. It is a great deal if you get the package for discount or use one of their monthly specials. I highly recommend you to give this place a try!',

I went to him to have botched chin implant/augmentation/removal procedures that I had done with Dr. Peter Lee at Wave Plastic Surgery. I'm waiting to see if the result(s) here turn out better than Dr. Peter Lee at Wave Plastic Surgery. Thus far, they treated me with great customer service. Dr. Kahng says he could try improving what's already done to me, and for that, I thank him. It gives me hope there's a plastic surgeon out there who can do a good job.",

      "Procedure: mommy makeover on 6/6/23. Can I just say I love this place. From the front desk to the nurses to the anesthesiologist to the doctor. Everyone there is so beyond professional and welcoming it has made this whole experience so much better. The office is always clean and put together. The front desk is so welcoming and friendly. I was assigned Maritza as my coordinator and I can't say enough good things about her. She has been there for me from the very beginning. From answering all my questions to helping me with the financial side of it to even answering me on her days off. She is just absolutely amazing! The nurses Vanessa and Jocelyn just wow. They make everything just so much better. Their knowledge and kindness is something I won't forget. They make me feel so at ease while at the same time keeping it real with how things are going to feel and what to expect. They don't seem to get annoyed when I flinch or ask to many questions. Sorry ladies. Now the day of the procedure. I was so nervous. I was really trying to keep myself calm. The nurse I had (which I wish I could remember her name) was fantastic! She kept me so calm with her jokes and her calm demeanor. Literally the absolute best! Even her aftercare which I remember some of. I remember her just being there for me and very attentive. The anesthesiologist Dr. Ye is a great one to. So informative and really took the best care of me. I felt sick waking up but once they gave me medicine for it I was perfectly fine. He did fantastic. Shoutout to the OR tech also because they don't get enough shoutouts. Finally Dr. Kahng. He is great. I love how calm and relaxed he is. I told him how I wanted to look natural and not have big breast implants. They are still swollen but I'm so happy with the results so far. He really took what I said and listened. There are really not enough words to express my gratitude to each and everyone at this office who made this process so smooth and easy. I would recommend you guys over and over again.",

      'I cannot say enough good things about my experience with Dr. David Kahng! One year post op (breast aug) and I am beyond satisfied with my results. I sought many consultations before deciding to move forward with this procedure and that was in large part after seeing Dr. Kahng and learning everything I needed to know about the process. All of my questions were answered, I felt so comfortable from start to finish, and I felt very in control and in the loop with everything big to small. You need to have trust and good communication for a surgery like this and they knocked it out of the park. Also... JULIE! She is the best, she made me feel like an absolute queen the entire year long journey. So kind, sweet and caring - actually this goes for the entire staff! Everyone was always so helpful and welcoming. There is a lot that goes into this procedure - many pre op appointments, post op care, and follow ups through the first year of recovery. Honestly any time I had to go in for a check up or appointment, I looked forward to it! I knew it would be a good experience. Best of luck to anyone considering this journey - I am so glad I did and with CARA / Dr. Kahng!',

      "People have been asking about my experience with dr. kahng, so i thought i would just post about it. My experience was super smooth, throughout the whole process. everyone at the clinic was super nice (julie was my consultant, love her), including the doctor himself. he holds himself with a quiet confidence, and was clear and honest about what my expectations should be. just overall a very pleasant person. Surgery day came and i was NERVOUS but the nurses were so kind and made sure to ask if i had any questions. almost 3 hrs later, i was wheeled out to the car. after the 30 min drive home, i was ready to walk around and talk. there was no pain throughout the healing process-- at least in my experience. the first night was the most unpleasant, because i had to get used to breathing through my mouth. but after 2 days, i could stop using a drip pad, and halfway through the first week they had me come in for a gentle cleaning. you do not do any of the cleaning yourself!!! no peroxide, no saline, only water and q-tips for blood that dried outside the nose. they will do the cleaning for you. i got it cleaned 3 days post, 1 week post, and 2 weeks post. I did not have any significant swelling or bruising after the surgery. obviously, my nose is swollen, but i didn't look like i had two black eyes at any point. no one at the clinic seemed surprised at this-- i truly think dr. kahng is just hella good at his job. The full cost included anesthesia and post surgery visits, which i was glad to hear. (AND A STEROID SHOT they give u in the first week post op!) my swelling is going down slowly but surely! even though i'm only a couple weeks out, i'm still very pleased with the results (i got the bridge shaved, the sides slimmed, and cartilage added to the tip (he uses donor cartilage)). Overall, i can't recommend him enough, especially for asian clients. :)",

I flu from New York for consultation and after having the meeting I was more at ease. Dr. Kahng did an amazing job during my consultation answering every question and I left. He explained in detail what he can do and I showed what I want my new nose to look like. It has been only two months and I can definitely see that he's done a great job and he did exactly as promised and I'm very happy with the result. Given it will look even better few months down the road. His team of nurses were very attentive and helpful at every step. The medical facility is very clean and a professional environment. The recovery was short for me and painless. All my questions and concerns were answered in a timely fashion, I was never rushed at any time and my results are amazing. I'm glad I made the trek to Los Angeles and very happy when I look in the mirror. I'm very thankful to Dr. Kahng and I hope he helps more women/men to feel and look even more confident.

I feel like suture method isn't as good as the surgical method at correcting asymmetry, but who knows. But I'm loving the results, it's been two years post op and I love how they've healed! It's exactly what I wanted. I didn't want a big lid, I wanted a natural lid to maintain the mono lid look a little bit. This is what I told Dr. kahng and I think he did great to honor my preference.

      "Dr. Kahng and his associates are such wonderful people. What drew me to this facility as opposed to its competitors is the welcoming vibe that I sensed from the first interaction. There was another doctor I considered but I chose Dr. Kahng because he has a calm, welcoming, and non-judgmental demeanor. I think with any beauty service, it's common to feel vulnerable so for me personally, I prioritized trusting my gut feeling. So far I'm glad I went with CARA. Two front office assistants and the nurse I have interacted with all have been so lovely. I knocked off one star because there are times that I feel Dr. Kahng is rushed and the last time I spoke with the front desk person she sounded a bit annoyed. However, 9/10 times my experience has been positive so a 4-star review seems reasonable at this time. The last thing I'd like to mention is that IMHO, CARA has conveyed ethnic diversity and acceptance of everyone regardless of skin color, race, and/or gender. I am making this statement based on the 3+ visits I've had so far.",

I wanted a BBL (Brazilian butt lift) since I was 16 and for my 23rd birthday this year I looked for a surgeon that does BBL's near my home and that was when I came across CARA Plastic Surgery Center on Yelp. I was impressed by their positive reviews so I looked through their website and photo galleries. I immediately contacted them for a virtual consultation and they responded back the very next hour! :) After the virtual consultation I was set on going through with the BBL procedure. All the nurses and doctors I have spoken to have been nothing but professional and kind. They of course follow all the new COVID-19 rules and are extremely patient with you. I'm so happy I chose CARA for my first surgery and they left me with very natural looking results. :) They answer any and all questions you have as well as demonstrate how to put on the compression garment and faja you will need (both came for free). All in all you won't regret coming here and I cannot thank everyone enough at this center for being accommodating and helpful throughout the whole process.

      "I have monolids and have been wanting eyelid surgery for a long time. I've done many consultations with various plastic surgeons around Los Angeles, but never felt like any of them were a good fit. However, when I did a consultation with CARA plastic surgery in SG, I immediately felt like the staff truly cared about my needs. The consultant, V, spent a long time with me explaining the surgery, pricing, risks and benefits of different procedures, and answered all of the questions I had. She even gave me her phone number and I've texted her many times with questions that she responded to immediately. Because of this, I felt very comfortable moving forward with the procedure. I wanted the suture method but another doctor had previously told me that I did not have the right anatomy for suture method. During my consult with Doctor Kahng, he seemed very knowledgeable and assessed me and was confident that his three minimal suture method would work for me. It's been 2 months post procedure and I am SO happy with the results. it exceeded my expectations!! Initially the swelling lasted for around a week, and one eye had bruising for 2 weeks, but they recommended home remedies that worked wonderfully for both bruising and swelling! There were no other complications . They scheduled follow up appointments and I felt like the quality of care continued on even after the surgery. I would highly recommend Cara plastic surgery to anyone.",

      "I'm usually wary of medical services..especially of this nature..and especially korean places because I just assume they are money hungry (I'm also Korean by the way). The issues I wanted addressed were acne scars I've unfortunately been left with from severe teenage acne..and some from adulthood. I'd like to say that my entire experience here has been nothing short of wonderful. Julie, who was my consultant, was patient, kind, and understanding. She didn't shove any services to my face...instead she suggested what she believed were best treatment options to me and at very reasonable costs (I visited a dermatology office before this and the prices were just outlandishly expensive). I felt no burden onto her whatsoever as I was talking my mouth off...of my acne history, bad experiences with dermatologists, price concerns, and ineffective treatments. Again, her patience was much appreciated. Thank you Julie. I was then greeted by such an angel of a person....Alice, who was going to treat me. I naturally have high anxiety and stress easily...but she genuinely made me feel really comfortable. She also took the time to explain things I didnt know about certain aspects of acne...and she inspected me very closely to further explain what sort of corrections I can have...and preventative measures I can take to better manage my skin. Nothing felt painful and she did this cute thing where she would warn me before every time she would initiate the treatment on the problematic spots. Alice... you are so kind, thank you. I already see improvements and it's only been a few hours. Dr. Kahng... I would like to say you definitely hired professional and interpersonal individuals to be part of your staff. Please give them a raise or treat them out to Kang Ho Dong next door ^_^; I'm going to come back for other issues I want corrected. JULIE AND ALICE...YOU GUYS ARE AWESOME!!!",

Ve is so helpful answering and replying to all my text (I was so paranoid due to my first experience, I want to make sure this is the RIGHT place to go) I decided to proceed my procedure with Dr. Kahng (Best choice ever, no I am not exaggerating). From my first impression booking for a consultation to getting the surgery done and coming back for follow ups, everyone is so welcoming and helpful!

      'Got a facial today (water course), V was very kind and friendly to explain to me the process of the course. The skin care specialist was very gentle while massaging my face and neck, I fell asleep. The product they used all smelled so nice and fresh. After the water course, my face looked and felt super clean! THANK YOU!!!',

      "Love this place! I get my lips injected by the head nurse Vanessa, and omg I must say she is amazing! She's so funny and makes me feel comfortable when injecting! Totally numbs you my mouth and I don't feel a thing. She's very knowledgeable in her field and answers all questions and concerns. The staff is very friendly and great at keeping in touch with future appointments. Thank you so much Vanessa!",

      'My wife did her upper eyes surgery here, we came for a follow up session and I spoke to the consultant about little things that I can do for improvement. They are very professional and did not try to oversell me. The consultant suggested me to start with Botox to remove my wrinkles on forehead, proceeded with her recommendation and the results are great. My wife is also very happy with her double eyelid, happy wife happy life!',

      "Being close to 40, you have to worry about your skin sagging and horrific lines showing up on your face. Sorry but those $2000 face creams really don't help much to erase those worry lines and sad sad wrinkles. I had an amazing plastic surgeon/friend who first did Botox on me at UCLA, but with the distance and I know he would rather do reconstructive breast surgery from cancer than simply inject me. Therefore, I yelped and yelped and found CARA. I wanted somewhere closer to me with great reviews and good pricing. When I called, it was easy to make an appointment and the ladies were so kind. I came in and the office on the day of my appointment and it was so nice, clean and presentable. The ladies were so kind at the front desk, filled out some forms and within 5 minutes, I was called in. Alice, the RN, was the one who injected me with Botox. Before the injections, she studied my face and asked what concerned me most. She was so thorough and yes, I am still nervous with the needles, but she was so calm and took her. We discussed what areas needed the injections and before she proceeded, she gave me an ice pack which tremendously helped for my face. Oh do I love that ice pack! Then, all the many tons and tons of injections were done without pain. It was amazing and Alice was amazing. I literally had no pain and did not wince for her skills are so smooth and professional. The prices are so reasonable and with her skills, would I be back? Yes. To Botox and youth, yes. Updated Review 10/11/2019: So I came back today to have Botox again with Alice, the RN and right away, with no waiting, she was already there waiting for me! I LOVE that she gave me ice packs for my face to hold on to, so that it helps with the bruising and injections. Her injections are so precise and not painful at all! She really knows what she is doing. We first go over what areas I want to get done and she truly listens and understands my problem areas. It was so quick and easy and no bruising! This place is truly reasonable and wonderful for botox injections. Their pricing is so fair and making the appointment is so easy. The office staff are so friendly and the entire clinic is so modern, clean and neat. There is parking in the back of 3rd Street or front meter parking $1/hr.",

      "I love the treatments and the results! As I am getting toward 50's, I have noticed some aging signs like wrinkles and sagging skins on my face. My biggest concern was my laugh lines were getting more pronounced. It really bothered me and I even lost confidence too. I decided to get Botox and filler. It was my first time having it, so I was little worried and scared until I met my beauty consultant, Clara and a nurse. They were very knowledgeable, friendly and professional. They recommended me minimal treatments as I am a starter. I only got 1 syringe of Juvederm for my laugh lines and 10 units of Botox for my eye wrinkles. As soon as filler was placed, I could see the difference on my face. I was impressed to see such a fast result. Botox would take about a week to see the results. Now I look more refreshed, vibrant and young. I am very happy about results and will definitely return in the future. I recommend the treatment to everyone who is thinking of the treatment of Botox and filler. Also, it wasn't painful if you are scared of needles.",

      "I've gotten multiple treatments of Botox and Filler with the nurses here and it was amazing and this has led me to proceed with cosmetic surgery here! I have been tempted since after pregnancy with Liposuction and also Breast Augmentation. I knew this will be the best decision, it has been 1 year since my surgery and the results are amazing. I also went to get a second opinion at other offices and they told me I needed a breast lift. But Dr. Kahng proceed and told me an implant will be sufficient to give me a lift, I went with his decision and he also told me I do not need a Tummy tuck since I do not have a lot of sagging skin. We went ahead and proceeded with a stomach, flanks and arm lipo. Nurses are very supportive throughout my recovery and during my follow ups. I have also been very religious on putting on my compression garment throughout my recovery. Overall, I am very satisfied and without doubt be rating this place 7 out of 5 starts",
